## Development server

* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files
* Alternatively, run `docker-compose up`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build

## Running tests

* Run `npm test` to execute unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)
* Run `npm run test:coverage` to execute unit tests and generate a coverage report (at `<rootDir>/coverage/`)
* Run `npm run test:watch` to execute unit tests while watching for file changes
* Run `ng e2e` to execute end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/)

## Tips

To update angular dependencies, run: `npm i -g @angular/cli` then `npx ng update @angular/core@9 @angular/cli@9`

## Tools

## To-do

* More items in the shop
* Minion level up
* Export / import save data (for transferring across machines)
